## Project submission:
* a link to a Github repository with the script for performing the analysis
* a code book that describe the variables, the data, and any tranformations or work to clean up the data
* a README.md included
* a R script called run_analysis.R to do the following:
  1. Merges the training the test sets to creat one data set.
  2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
  3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
  4. Appropraiately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
  5. From the data in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
